Title: Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease

Abstract:
Motivation: This research aims to evaluate different machine learning techniques for predicting chronic kidney disease (CKD), compare their performance, and analyze the potential of neural networks to enhance accuracy. Improving prognosis can enable personalized medicine and better outcomes.
Results: The study reveals that artificial neural networks integrated into sophisticated machine learning ensembles can boost diagnostic accuracy and model performance for CKD prognosis.

Background:
Conventional diagnostic techniques often fail to provide a thorough understanding of the course and severity of CKD. Machine learning algorithms can analyze complex medical data to uncover patterns and develop CKD prediction models. Previous studies have shown promising results using decision trees, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and artificial neural networks for CKD prediction.

Methodology:
The study compares various machine learning algorithms, including GaussianNB, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, LGBM Classifier, and KNeighbors Classifier. It also explores integrating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to improve prediction accuracy. The study uses a benchmark dataset from the UCI repository and addresses the issue of missing data by imputing null values.

Implementation:
The study imports necessary libraries, preprocesses the dataset (imputing null values, encoding data, finding correlations, scaling features), splits the data into training and test sets, and implements the selected machine learning models, including an ANN model built using the Keras library.

Results:
The study presents the significant results obtained from the implementation of various models, including Random Forest (97.5% accuracy), XGBoost Classifier (97.5% accuracy), SVM (65% accuracy on the test set), KNN (95% accuracy), Naive Bayes (minimal mean absolute error of 0.225), Decision Tree, XGBRF Classifier (97% accuracy), LGBM Classifier (99% accuracy), and ANN (99% accuracy on the validation set after 10 epochs).

Conclusion & Future Work:
The report concludes by highlighting the potential of machine learning algorithms, particularly artificial neural networks integrated into ensembles, to enhance the accuracy of CKD prognosis. Future work could involve iterative pruning implementation and exploring dynamic or post-training quantization on the obtained model.
